Flutter Hive Login Demo
A simple Flutter authentication app built as our first college project, using Hive (NoSQL local database) for storing user credentials locally on the device.

This app demonstrates:
🔑 Sign up (store username & password in Hive)
🔓 Login (validate from Hive)
🏠 Navigate to Home Page after login
🎨 Modern UI with gradients, rounded inputs, and error/success messages
💾 Persistent storage (data stays even after app restart)
