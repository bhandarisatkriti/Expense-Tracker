Flutter Hive Login Demo

A simple Flutter authentication app built as our first college project, using Hive (NoSQL local database) for storing user credentials locally on the device.

This app demonstrates:

🔑 Sign up (store username & password in Hive)

🔓 Login (validate from Hive)

🏠 Navigate to Home Page after login

🎨 Modern UI with gradients, rounded inputs, and error/success messages

💾 Persistent storage (data stays even after app restart)
